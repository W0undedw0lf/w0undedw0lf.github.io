                    <h2>Fixes to CSS</h2>
                    <p>Silly me forgot that people with 4K monitors exist in the world. Reformatted some CSS to keep proper formatting at much higher resolutions. I also went back and corrected some typos and grammar in places on the page.</p>
                    <p>Update: Added button animations to make it more clear when save/load is interacted with successfully.</p>

                    <h2>Dice Roller Added</h2>
                    <p>Well, that was fast. With a little help from my friend we were able to get a dice roller up and running on the character sheet. We lack the means to post rolls publicly, but if you want to roll on the go and don't feel like using Avrae for some reason, it's arrived. You can specify a number of dice, the faces of the dice, and a bonus you would like to add TO EACH DICE ROLLED. This dice roller does not currently support sum total rolling unless you are rolling just one dice. It was designed with what we need it for in mind.</p>
                    <p>I'll continue to try and think up new things that might help us. Maybe just stick to some tutorial for now and see if I discover something we can use. But eventually the best improvement will come when I start learning back-end development. Which is probably a ways out. That would help us with things like character sheet storage, forums, public and shared rolls, etc. Basically anything that would hold data for another user to access. So heres to hoping that happens sooner rather than later!</p>

                    <h2>New Site Launched!</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys! I've gone and expanded the webpage a bit to hold more than just the character sheet should we need it. I'm not sure what else we'll need in the future, but for now I've just copied and pasted the rules from the google doc and included it in the "Rules" page you can find in the header.</p>
                    <p>If theres something you'd like to see added in the future, please let me know. Here are some of the ideas I've got for the future:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Expand the functionality of the Chracter Sheet.</li>
                        <p>This is my primary concern as it was what I set out to make when I started developing this page.</p>
                        <li>(Interactive?) Map</li>
                        <p>Not sure how I'd do this but goals direct research.</p>
                        <li>Dice Roller</li>
                        <p>This seems like a natural progression. I've got a basic one working, but I need to figure out how to roll several dice at once and print individual results.</p>
                        <li>Blog?</li>
                        <p>This is less development concerned but I'd be happy to post articles if other people want to write them. Just to have a collective place for us to preserve it all.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you have any other ideas or like the sound of anything I listed above, let me know!</p>

                    <p>Currently our lads are on their way to the water, and in one month's time, a Tournament for Iron and Bronze Rank Adventurers. Will they survive the walnuts? Will Chris ever find a moment of peace? Will Brent ever finish this site and learn how to make our own dice roller? Doubtful on all accounts ...</p>
