            <h2>The Rules</h2>
            <h3>Each Character Has:</h3>
            <p>6 different racial abilities
            4 essence slots. Each essence has 5 abilities.
            Each essence is tied to a stat.</p>
            
            <h3>The Stats</h3>

            <h4>Speed</h4>
            <p>Iron Rank-40 ft of movement. 2 actions in a turn. Max of +1 extra action. Each extra action takes 2 stamina. +1 advantage to rolls involving speed.  4d6 attack die. Rank decides hit parameters.
            EXAMPLE-It would be 3+ on the d6 to land a success on an iron monster as an iron adventurer. It would be 4+ to land on a low bronze monster. A high bronze would take 5+</p>

            <h4>Spirit</h4>
            <p>Iron Rank-All non-physical attacks gain +1 damage. Each rank of iron will give +1 mana. May spend 2 mana to increase nonphysical damage by 1.  +1 advantage to rolls involving spirit.</p>
            <h4>Recovery</h4>
            <p>Iron Rank- All Health, Mana, Stamina, regenerate at 5 per hour. (At iron rank, cant just go into trouble back to back. Have to be somewhat careful. Base regen can be buffed through essence abilities.)</p>

            <h4>Power</h4>
            <p>Iron Rank-All physical attacks gain +1 damage. May spend 1 stamina to increase physical damage by 1. +1 advantage to rolls involving power.
            The 4 main stats will level up through the ranks as the abilities/essence tied to them level up. Abilities level up through use. Leveling is twice as fast whilst life is on the line (fighting)</p>
            
            <h4>Everything Has Ranks</h4>
            <p>Everything starts at iron 0 and goes to iron 9. Abilities, stats
            Without essence, no bonuses. Pseudo Iron will be +1s. Iron rank is +2s</p>

            <h4>Health</h4> 
            <p>(Power+Recovery)10  Iron=20 health. Bronze 60 health</p>

            <h4>Mana</h4> 
            <p>[(Spirit+Recovery)10]2 Iron 40  (this equation includes Dracodalys racial)</p>

            <h4>Stamina</h4>
            <p>(Speed+Power)10</p>
            <p>Armor and magic resist will be flat damage reduc. Certain weapons/abilities will bypass reductions.<p>


            <p>Hitting an iron monster will be 1-2 success based on how fast they are. 
            Hitting a bronze monster will be 3+.
            advantages/abilities will add more dice to the attacking rule. Disadvantages will do the opposite.</p>

            <h4>EXTRA ACTIONS</h4>
            <p>Attacking/moving same rules apply.</p>
            <p>Reactions- Can be made on turn of threats.</p>
            <p>Parry/dodge is speed (4d6)  4+ for same rank. Two success negate damage. 1 success halves damage</p>
            <p>Counter, half the damage of the attack and attack back. (4d6) 4+ on same rank is success. Requires same amount of success as the attack normally would.</p>



            <h4>SKILLS</h4> 
            <p>Can be gained through actions or skill books</p>
            <p>Naturally gained skills will have +1d6 to any rolls</p>
            <p>Skills at beginner start with 3D6, 2+-5+ will be based on difficulty of the check or what they are doing. If it is in line with skill level, like beginner skill vs beginner check it will be 3+</p>
            <p>Skills will go as- Beginner, Proficient, Something, Expert, Something, Sage</p>

            <h4>Aura<h4>
            <p>Before iron there is no aura</p>
            <p>At Iron an ability linked to spirit will give access to aura. </p>

            <h4>Experience</h4>

            <p>Based on situations DM can award extra exp</p>

            <h5>Non-combat Iron rank</h5>
            <p>5% for no cd, 10 small cd, 20% for large cd (Except lick wounds, consider it in combat for exp)</p>


            <h5>Combat Iron rank</h5>
            <p>Iron 0-2 10% per use, small cd 20%, large cd 50%</p>
